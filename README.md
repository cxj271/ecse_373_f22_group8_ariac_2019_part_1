# ecse_373_ariac_2019_part_1

**How to run:**

1. Run the launch file for the simulation environment and the controller node

```
roslaunch cwru_ecse_373_submission competition_launch.launch
```

This launch file will do the following:

- Start the simulation environment
- Start the ariac 2019 competition
- Start the ros node to control the robot arm


This is for the final project. The arm goes to each part, turns on the
gripper, lifts, lowers, then turns off the gripper.
